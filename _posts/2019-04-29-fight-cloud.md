Fight Cloud is a cartoon themed VR game for HTC Vive in which players traverse a surreal wasteland with silly physics-based weapons to slay enemies.

* Communicated with other leads to ensure devs met individual and team goals.

Contributed system/gameplay code in cooperation with my team:
* Weapon system
* Player input

* Individual weapon behavior
