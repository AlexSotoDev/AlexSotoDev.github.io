Over Easy is a 3D mobile platformer where players navigate a diverse set of levels and environments using their device's gyroscope to roll/tilt an egg to safety. It was developed by myself and three other students (Eddie Yanez, Sean Dirr, Shola John) at DePaul for our Capstone Project from January 2018 - June 2018. 
It is currently available in Early Access via the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TheCoop.OverEasy) for Android devices, featuring over 2 dozen levels spanning 5 worlds with unique obstacles.

## Role

I served as lead designer, systems programmer, gameplay programmer, and level designer.
Some of my contributions and responsibilities: 
* Led initial design/prototype vision.
* Designed multiple levels per 5 environments (farm, forest, desert, lake, arctic). 
* Created and iterated on camera, level, and player input controller classes.
* Programmed level obstacles (moving/rotating/flipping platforms, timed physics based enemies, area-specific environmental obstacles).
* Designed and implemented post-win egg hatching/cracking mechanic.
